[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/social_parser/lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

A small library for parsing out common social elements such as hashtags, mentions and urls.

## Usage

Install by adding `social_parser` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:social_parser, "~> 0.4.0"}]
end
```

And then run the mix task to download and compile social_parser:

```shell
mix deps.get
```

Once installed you can parse out the social components like so:

```elixir
defmodule SocialParserTest do
  def do_social_stuff() do
    message = "Hi @you check out http://example.com/ that +someone hosted #examples"

    components = SocialParser.parse(message)

    IO.inspect(components)
    # %{
    #   links: ["http://example.com/"],
    #   mentions: ["@you", "+someone"],
    #   tags: ["#examples"]
    # }
  end
end
```
